/**
 *
 *ProcessControlBlock class, this is the PCB construct we learned about. It contains meta
 * information about a process. It has:
 * o A reference to a SimProcess, this is set in the constructor and has a getter
 * o An int to store the current instruction, has a getter and a setter
 * o 4 int values for the values of 4 different registers with getters and setters (similar to
 * SimProcess, you can have separate getters and setters, or have methods that take a
 * parameter)
 *
